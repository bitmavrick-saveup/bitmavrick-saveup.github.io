    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        SaveUp ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our app
        works and what data we collect.
    </p>

    <h2>Offline Usage</h2>
    <p>
        SaveUp is designed to work fully offline. All your savings data and progress are stored locally on your device.
        We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or financial data to our servers or any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect any user data. The app does not require any account, login, or internet connection to function
        (except for advertisements served via Google AdMob).
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        While the app itself is offline and does not collect data, we use the following third-party services:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – For serving ads. AdMob may collect anonymous usage data such as device type,
            IP address, and advertising identifiers to provide personalized ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase</strong> – Used only for internal testing or basic analytics related to app performance
            (e.g., crashes). No personally identifiable information is collected by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These services may collect data in accordance with their respective privacy policies:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy and Security</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        SaveUp does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since the app is
        offline and does not collect user data, it is safe for use by all ages.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        All your savings data is stored locally on your device. We encourage users to regularly back up their devices in
        case of data loss.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the effective
        date will be updated accordingly.
    </p>
